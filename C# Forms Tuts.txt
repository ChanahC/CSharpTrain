Form:
The header - called a text... setting it is like this.Text = "*something*";
Size = setting it requires the Size class under System.Drawing;

/*
Coding Practice: if you have many pictures/images to be added on your application, it's better to use an ImageList. But if you are using image list instead of image, you should use componentName.ImageIndex = *some int value which represents the index of the image on the image list.*
*/

Components on the form:

When assigning the location of the components, use the class Point under System.Drawing;

1. Button (Under System.Forms.Form.Button) - when you used the buttonName.Click, assign it to a function that it would be executing. You can add an image to the button by using buttonName.image = *img class*;
2. TextBox (Under System.Forms.Form.TextBox);
3. MainMenu - it the the menu bar which is positioned on the top... below the header. It can contain MenuItems....
To add a MenuItem... mainMenuName.Add(menuItemName);
4. Menu Item - it is the values that you see on the main menu or on another main item. It can contain many sub menu items in it.
To add a MenuItem object on another MenuItem object - menuItem1.MenuItem.add(menuItem2); and you can set its menuItemName.Click into a function.
5. MenuStrip - something like a MainMenu object, but it's counterpart for the MenuItem is the ToolStripItem;
6. Label (can contain either text or image.... if you want to see an image.... labelName.image = someImageObject)
7. TextBox - can have a TextChange event handler.... which is somewhat a counterpart of a button's Click. If you set textBoxName.Multiline = true, then the text box would allw the user to input multiline text.
8. Panel - for grouping purpose
9. Checkbox - to have the changes seen, use the function checkBoxName.CheckedChanged and set it to some functions;
10. GroupBox
11. TrackBar - .ValueChanged
